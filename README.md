Hello Everyone, 

Nublet here. I have basic C++ programming skills with limited knowledge of OOP.
Currently a student through the OSU Computer Science Post-Bacc program. It took
entirely too long to figure out I enjoy working with data sets and numbers and 
not medicine or lab bench science. I hope to continue learning and using the 
resources on the web as vehicles to foster opportunities for learning and insight
into the field of CS. 

Free to ask questions!
