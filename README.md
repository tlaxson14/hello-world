Repository for ideas

Hello Everyone, 

I hope to show through hard work and the right mindset it's not only possible to learn 
programming and computer science, but it's probable. Solving problems and helping others
learn how to problem-solve is a worthwhile cause. 

Currently I have basic C++ programming skills with limited knowledge of OOP. Working 
through the chapter-based programming assignments.

I plan to return the knowledge that helped me learn with repositories of chapter-based 
programming assignments -- difficulty ranging easy to hard. I will also include modified 
versions of school projects to show competency from a reputable CS program at OSU. 
In addition you will find various projects related to interests. 

Feel free to critique or ask questions!

Ciao
