Hello Everyone, 

Nublet here. I have basic C++ programming skills with limited knowledge of OOP.
Currently a student through the OSU Computer Science Post-Bacc program. It took
entirely too long to figure out I enjoyed working with data sets and not medicine 
or bench science. I hope to continue learning and using the resources on the web 
as vehicles to foster growth and opportunity into the field of CS. 

Free to ask questions!
